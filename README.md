## 💻 Project

This project is a study of multiple software development principles that compose the CLEAN architecture, created by Robert C. Martin. These principles and best practices are applied to create a robust and maintainable code base.

This API will handle **surveys** creation, listing, responding and survey results, including user registration and authentication.

## ☀️ Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Separation of Concerns (SOC)
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
