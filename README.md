## üíª Project

This project is a study of multiple software development principles that compose the CLEAN architecture, created by Robert C. Martin. These principles and best practices are applied to create a robust and maintainable code base.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
